## Information :
  - As it was mentioned to make it paginated, I have introduced two new variables limit and page. 
  - Page gives us the page no. we want to visit.
  - Limit gives us the no. of documents we want on one single page.
  - As it wasn't possible to add frontend like pagination I have made the first page of application where you can enter page np. and limit so that it'll take you there.
